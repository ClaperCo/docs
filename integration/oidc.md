By default, Claper authenticate users with email and password. With OpenID Connect, you can use an external provider like Google or a custom identity provider supporting OpenID Connect.

Refers to the [configuration](/self-hosting/configuration.md) section to see how to set up OpenID Connect on your own instance.
