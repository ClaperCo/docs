# Getting started

Are ready to use Claper ?

There are two ways to use Claper:

- Use the Cloud version available at [app.claper.io](https://app.claper.io)
- Use the self-hosted version to install on your own server.

## Cloud version

The Cloud version is the easiest way to use Claper. You don't need to install anything, just create an account and start using it.

When ou create a presentation, you have to choose between different tiers:

- **Small**: Free, limited to 25 attendees and a maximum file size of 5MB.

- **Medium**: Paid (1 credit), limited to 100 attendees and a maximum file size of 30MB.

- **Large**: Paid (2 credits), limited to 200 attendees and a maximum file size of 100MB.

When you choose a tier, it is valid for one presentation.

:::warning Be careful
You cannot change the tier once the presentation is created.

## Self-hosted version

The self-hosted version is for you if you want to have full control over your data and your presentations. You can install it on your own server and use Claper freely without any limitation.

Check the [installation guide](/self-hosting/prerequisites) to know how to install Claper on your server.
