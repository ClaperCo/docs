# Reports

When the presentation is over, you can access to the report with all the messages and reactions and other statistics about the presentation engagement.

## How to access the report?

To access the report, you have to terminate your event. To do so, click on the **"Terminate"** red button of your event. Then, you will be able to access the report.

## Metrics

The report contains the following metrics:

- **Audience peak**: The maximum number of attendees who were connected at the same time.
- **Unique attendees**: The number of unique attendees.
- **Messages**: The total number of messages sent.
- **Engagement rate**: The percentage of attendees who interacted during your event.

### Engagement rate calculation

The engagement rate is an important metric to understand the engagement of your audience. It is calculated using the following formula:

- Messages (m): **All distinct messages sent** / **Number of unique attendees**.
- Polls (p): **All the polls submitted** / (**Number of polls** x **Number of unique attendees**).
- Forms (f): **All the forms submitted** / (**Number of forms** x **Number of unique attendees**).
- Quizzes (q): **All the quizzes submitted** / (**Number of quizzes** x **Number of unique attendees**).

**Engagement rate = (m + p + f + q) / 4**
