# Facilitators

Facilitators are users who can moderate the messages from the [Event manager](/usage/manager.md) but cannot delete or edit your presentation.

## Add a facilitator

When you create a new event, you can add a facilitator by entering their email address. They will receive an email to be informed about it.

## Get access as a facilitator

Once the facilitator has created an account with the same email address, they will be able to access the event as a facilitator.
