# Create your first presentation

## Preparations

The first thing you need to have is your **Powerpoint or Keynote presentation**.

Do you plan to add a poll or ask questions?

Plan slides that will include interactions, if it's a poll, take care to have a slide with the title of your poll. Each interaction will be linked to a slide in your presentation.

When everything is ready, you must **save/export your presentation in PDF or PPT/PPTX format**.

:::info High-fidelity presentation
It is recommended to use PDF format, which will guarantee you a final rendering identical to the original.

You now have your exported presentation and ready to be imported into Claper.

## Using Claper

**Log in to your Claper account** and create a new presentation.

**Upload your file** then choose a **name** for your event, a **code** that will allow your attendees to join the event and a start and end date.
Your attendees will not be able to join the event before the start date and will not be able to join after your terminate it.

Note that at the end of your presentation, you will have access to your **statistical report** in order to know the engagement rate and other useful metrics.

**It's time to add interactions!**

You can add interactions during your presentation or prepare them ahead of time.
