# Account

## Create an account

To create an account, you need to provide your email and a password. Once your account is created, you will be able to log in and access your account settings.

If someone else shared an event with you, you will see it in your dashboard. You can also create your own events.

## Account settings

Your account settings are accessible from the top-right corner of the page, where you can see your email. By clicking on it, you will be able to access your account settings. Here, you can **change your email**, **password**, and **delete your account**.

## Delete your account

To delete your account, you need to log in and go to your account settings. Then, you can click on the "Delete account" button. Please note that this action is irreversible and all your data will be lost.
