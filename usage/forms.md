# Forms

You can also add forms during your presentation. Users can fill the form and you can see all submissions in real time.

When you create a new presentation, click on **Present/Customize**, select the slide where you want to add form and click **Add interaction**.

After your presentation, you can export all the submissions in CSV format.
