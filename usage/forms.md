# Forms

It's useful to know your attendees and collect feedback during your presentation. You can create a form with Claper to collect information from your attendees in real-time.

Users can fill the form, and you can see all submissions and export them later.

## Create a form

First, you have to define a **title**, to identify your form.

Then, you can add **fields** to your form. You can choose between several types of fields:

- **Text**: A simple text field.
- **Email**: A field to collect email addresses.

You can add as many fields as you want.

## Export submissions

When your event is finished, you can export all the submissions in CSV format.

This is available on your [Report](/usage/reports.md) page.
