# Polls

![Poll Feature](/feature1.png)

Polls are a wonderful feature to engage your audience and get feedback in real time. You can create polls during your presentation and see the results in real-time.

Polls could be useful to get feedback on a specific topic, to decide, or to engage your audience.

## Create a poll

When you create a poll, you have to define a **title**, this is the question you want to ask your audience.

Then, you can add **choices** to your poll. You can choose between single choice and multiple choice polls.

If you want your attendees to be able to select multiple choices, you have to check the **Multiple answers** option. Otherwise, only one choice can be selected.

You can add as many choices as you want.

## Poll results

During your presentation, enable **Show poll results** on the [Event manager](/usage/manager.md#settings) to show the poll results on the screen and/or on the attendees' devices.

You can choose to hide results to avoid influencing your attendees.

:::warning
Attendees cannot change their answers once they have submitted them.
