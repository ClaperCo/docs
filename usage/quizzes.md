# Quizzes

![Quiz Feature](/quiz.png)

Quizzes are perfect for testing the knowledge of your audience. You can create quizzes during your presentation and see the results in real-time.

## Create a quiz

When you create a quiz, you can add up to 10 questions. Each question should have at least one correct answer.

You can add as many answers as you want for each question.

## Quiz results

When **Show results on presentation** is enabled, attendees can see their results once they have submitted their answers. This also displays the average score of the quiz in your presentation.

## Questions review

You can review the quiz answers by clicking the **Review questions** button in the [Event manager](/usage/manager.md). Use the next/previous buttons to navigate through the questions and review your audience's answers. This only affects your presentation view; attendees can independently navigate through the questions on their devices.
