# Web Content

Any web content like Youtube, Slideshare, Google Slides, etc. can be embedded in your presentation.

When you create a new presentation, click on **Present/Customize**, select the slide where you want to add embed and click **Add interaction**.

You can choose to show the embed in the attendee side, so your audience can see the embed content during your presentation.
